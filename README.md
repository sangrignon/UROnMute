# UROnMute
This project is created with JUCE. Follow the instructions below to install JUCE and open the 
UROnMute.jucer file with the projucer to create the android build. You will also need to install 
android studio from (https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Getting Started

The JUCE repository contains a [master](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/master)
and [develop](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/develop) branch. The develop branch
contains the latest bugfixes and features and is periodically merged into the master
branch in stable [tagged releases](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/releases)
(the latest release containing pre-built binaries can be also downloaded from the
[JUCE website](https://juce.com/get-juce)).

JUCE projects can be managed with either the Projucer (JUCE's own project-configuration
tool) or with CMake.

### The Projucer

The repository doesn't contain a pre-built Projucer so you will need to build it
for your platform - Xcode, Visual Studio and Linux Makefile projects are located in
[extras/Projucer/Builds](/extras/Projucer/Builds)
(the minimum system requirements are listed in the __System Requirements__ section below).
The Projucer can then be used to create new JUCE projects, view tutorials and run examples.
It is also possible to include the JUCE modules source code in an existing project directly,
or build them into a static or dynamic library which can be linked into a project.

For further help getting started, please refer to the JUCE
[documentation](https://juce.com/learn/documentation) and
[tutorials](https://juce.com/learn/tutorials).
